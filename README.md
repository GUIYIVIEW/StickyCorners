# StickyCorners
Objective-C implementation of StickyCorners from WWDC15

There are not many examples of UIDynamicBehaviors and UIDynamicAnimators for Objective-C.  Apple's [StickyCorners](https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/samplecode/StickyCorners/Introduction/Intro.html) from WWDC15 was a great example, but written in Swift.  I decided to roughly translate it to Objective-C.
